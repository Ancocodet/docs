# What is the lobby plugin

The Lobby plugin is an extension developed for Spigot-based Minecraft servers that can map all the required functions of a server hub.
It can be extended by addons, but already offers some functions by itself.

## Requirements

The lobby plugin requires a Spigot based server on a version between the 1.8.x and 1.12.x. To be able to use all functions a MySQL server is also required.
A version for all Spigot servers above 1.12 is planned but not yet in development.
